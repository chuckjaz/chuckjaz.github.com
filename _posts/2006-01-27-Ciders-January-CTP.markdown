better about timely blogging updates but given my past history maybe it would be
better if you checked the home page now and then...</p>

shipped it in December we really stole, uh, er, borrowed the grid design
experience from Sparkle (aka the Expression Interactive Designer) which is also
now available in CTP form available from

<p>The Cider CTPs are not beta quality. I say that to make sure you know what to
expect. We are delivering bits early and often to give all of you a chance to
influence our development by giving us early feedback on our design and the
general direction we are taking. I encourage all of you to take advantage of
this. We are listening and care a lot about what you think.</p>
