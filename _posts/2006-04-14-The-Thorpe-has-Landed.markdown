<p>Danny Thorpe, a long time friend and colleague of mine, has a new, new job
and a new <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/dthorpe/">blog</a>. We worked together
for a long time at his old old job. His old new job (or new old job?) was at
some little known internet search company. His new new job is at a small
software company based somewhere in Washington; the state not the city. Danny
once gave me a lab coat when I got a title of Chief Scientist. I need to think
of some suitable gift for someone with an equally inaccurate "manager" in his
title...</p>
