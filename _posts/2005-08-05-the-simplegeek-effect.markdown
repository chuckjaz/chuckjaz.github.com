It is truly amazing! My blog has been up since Saturday and has been getting trickle of traffic. Get a mention on ChrisAn's blog and watch it go! We should coin a new term:

> **The simple<span style="color: red">geek</span> effect** - the massive increase in blog readership because it was mentioned on www.simplegeek.com.

I sort of knew that would happen. Chris has a huge following. My passing comment about my blog to him this morning did have an ulterior motive. Thanks, Chris, for taking the hint and the nice words.
