I am off to PDC. This will be my first PDC as an "insider" instead of a
regular attendee, I am looking forward to it. We are announcing some very
exciting things! I am not going to be presenting but I will be available to
chat. I plan to spend most of my time in the "Big Room". If you don't know what
that is now, you will once you get there. I should be easy to spot, I will be
the guy in a blue Microsoft shirt and tan pants... ;-).
