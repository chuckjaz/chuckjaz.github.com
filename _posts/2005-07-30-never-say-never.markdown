Even though I have been quoted as saying I would never have a blog,
welcome to my blog. It teaches me never to say never.

If this blog looks familiar it is because I ripped off the implementation from
Chris Anderson. Like Chris, I will not restrict my self just to work life but
delve into other topics as well. I plan to keep them well separated so if you
don't want my personal version of a "sump-pump" story, relax, you can filter it
out.

I had visions of my first (non-introductory) post being earth shattering,
enlightening, and page-turning riveting example of clear technical writing about
an extremely interesting topic. Well, as it turns out, it is a rant. Oh, well;
maybe I can be enlightening later...
