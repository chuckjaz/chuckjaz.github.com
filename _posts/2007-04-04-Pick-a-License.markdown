<p>Reading <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000833.html">Pick
a License, Any License</a> by Jeff Atwood inspired me to pick one for the code I
post on this blog. I picked
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MS-PL">
MS-PL</a>. I certainly intended people to use the code I post, this make that
intent more clear. I have modified the my copyright footer to reflect this
selection.</p>

<p class="edit">[EDIT 01/21/2015: This has changed to be the Apache license or
the Ms-PL. MS-PL url was also updated.] </p>
