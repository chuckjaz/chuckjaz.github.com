Next week I will be attending
<a href="http://www.oopsla.org:8080/2005/ShowPage.do?id=Home&amp;referrer=www.removingalldoubt.com">OOPSLA</a>. This
will be my first technical conference where I will just be a regular attendee. I
have been to more conferences than I can count but I was always there on some
official reason either as a presenter or booth worker, or there for some special
event such as to launch a product or attend some award presentation. If you are
there too, feel free to stop me in the hall.
