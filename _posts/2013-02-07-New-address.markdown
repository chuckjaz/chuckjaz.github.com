<div class="text"><p>This blog&nbsp;had a&nbsp;good, long run on <a href="http://www.pocketsilicon.com/">Brian Pepin</a>&nbsp;servers he was gracious enough to host in is house. Brian's house, however,&nbsp;is going through some renovations so he&nbsp;decided to move his own web servers to Azure and shutdown his homegrown server farm. That means my free-loading days are over! I needed to do what I should have done a long time ago; move my blog to Azure.</p>
<p>If you see this post that means my blog has successfully moved! Onward and upward!</p></div>
